# How to play

So far this is a really simple (boring) game.
* Use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to move your character around on the screen.

* If your character is touched by one of the enemy bugs, the game starts over.

* In the future, there will be a way of making points and you will be able to kill the bugs when you catch them from behind.
